  - All counties in the state of Colorado.
  - All election races, Local and National, in the state of Colorado.
  - Presidential races
 
 It is our belief this script could be modified to support analysis for a wide variety of elections going forward.  It has been a pleasure to provide our state and country with this service.  We look forward to future endeavors and wish you all the best.  
Thank you.
